FEEDBACK:

Good implementation of the class Subsetsum findSubset() method.


Good documentation of your source code.


Extra Credit Opportunity:
+1 implementation of findSubset() for SongEntry type.
   Is not able to handle the duration when target is 0.
   Is not able to handle the case where the requested duration > sum of all elements
   in a reasonable amount of time.
   
+2 demonstration of successfully finding subsetsum in RUN.txt is required.
   However, next time make sure to test against a broader range of inputs.

-Bita.
