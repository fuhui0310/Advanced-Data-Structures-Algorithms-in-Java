# Advanced-Data-Structures-Algorithms-in-Java

The design and implementation of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, etc and algorithms for accessing and manipulating data structures. Also, the implementation of various sorting and searching algorithms, and analyzing a problem from many new points of view.

I will use a test driven development (TDD) approach in implementing our applications. The goal of this approach is to minimize bloated code by first defining how a feature is used before I start development. Otherwise, if I dive into writing code as soon as I talk to the client, I run the risk of spending lots of time on code and features that the user never uses, or writing buggy code that makes our application fail. My goal is to write good object oriented application that the user would want to use!
