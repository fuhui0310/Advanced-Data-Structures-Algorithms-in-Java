Overall, youâ€™ve made significant strides in improvement this quarter. Well done!


In your comment.txt why not combine the conclusion for your graph1.png and graph.png

Well done in annotating and overlaying the line graphs of different array sizes 
   in your graph3.png. However consider add a description on the annotation.
