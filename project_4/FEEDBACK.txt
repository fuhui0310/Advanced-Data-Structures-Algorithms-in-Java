FEEDBACK:

-10% late submission.

You're on the right track, however your implementation does not correctly
        update the lazy search tree for various test cases. 

        Provide additional test cases beyond those provided. Start with 
        *small* input test cases and *draw out* the resulting data structure. 
        If you are able to verify your results, then gradually build up to 
         more complex test cases. 	
         

-4 Incomplete implementation of findMin() and findMax()
   does not correctly traverse the tree of non-deleted nodes.
   See sample output 1, 2 and 3.

Suggestion: When searching for the minimum make sure to search
   both left and right subtrees:
   if (root is null)
      simply return;
   otherwise:
   findMin on left subtree and return node found;
   check if current root we're at is deleted, if not then return current root;
   findMin on right subtree and return node found;   <--- you are missing this key portion



Extra Credit:
+1 Good start to testing of findMin() and findMax() in class FoothillTuneStore.
   However, the current usage and result of findMin() and findMax() does not show
   that you are able to successfully find the min and max of the tree.
	
   For future make sure to successfully complete the required portion of the assigning
   before attempting the extra credit portion.
   See above sample output 4 and above feedback.
