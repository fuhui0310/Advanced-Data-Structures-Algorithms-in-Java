Very good use of HeapTuple in class heapArrayMerger!


-0.5 Do *not* change method signatures. 
   This includes the package name, list of file imports, visibility of methods, 
	capitalization of method names, order of arguments,
	handling of exceptions, etc.
	Otherwise it results in errors, effecting your grade.
    See sample compilation error below:
Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method 
   mergeSortedArrays(int, ArrayList<Integer[]>, HeapTuple[], String, boolean) from the type HeapArrayMerger.


-2 For Phase 1, use a sorting algorithm based on MEM_SIZE
   as required by project description.
       "The sorting algorithm should depend on the number of elements." 
   For large data set such as an array size greater than 1000 numbers
   which of the sorting algorithms is efficient?


-0 For future remove debugging output such as in class HeapArrayMerger:
System.out.println(test[i]);
   Otherwise it is difficult to identify key results.


-0 For future consider providing a description of the params to
   clarify their purpose in Javadocs.
      
-Bita.
